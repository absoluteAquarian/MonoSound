BUGS, ANNOYANCES AND/OR THINGS TO DO

- Low Pass filters can, for no reason, cause sound samples to be either 0 or +/-max.  Investigate
- Implement the rest of SoLoud's sound filters
- Implement the Filter/FilterInstance design from SoLoud (since it would make replacing/using filters be significantly easier)

Filter Testing:
- test low pass filter with various frequencies and resonance values

Feature Requests:
- native control over SubmitBuffer in StreamPackage (method for handling the call?)
  - necessitates making the StreamedSoundEffectInstance public
- ReadWav alternative for creating PCM data instead of WAVE data
- empty controllable StreamPackage creation
  - DynamicStreamPackage perhaps?
  - would have Func fields for handling the stream (DynamicStreamPackageBuilder for handling creation?)
- native support for ".pcm" files
  - might need a CustomAudioFormat since the sample metrics can't be in the file/stream
