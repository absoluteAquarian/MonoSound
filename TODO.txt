BUGS, ANNOYANCES AND/OR THINGS TO DO

- Low Pass filters can, for no reason, cause sound samples to be either 0 or +/-max.  Investigate
- Implement the rest of SoLoud's sound filters
- Implement the Filter/FilterInstance design from SoLoud (since it would make replacing/using filters be significantly easier)
