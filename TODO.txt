BUGS, ANNOYANCES AND/OR THINGS TO DO

- Low Pass filters can, for no reason, cause sound samples to be either 0 or +/-max.  Investigate
- Playing too many filtered sounds at once can cause crashes.  Investigate
- Implement the rest of SoLoud's sound filters
- calling StreamPackage.ApplyFilters too often causes crashes?  investigate
- filtered sounds are filled with blips of noise
